### Features

1. Time In and Out Module - Enable you to log your time and save in a persistent storage (text file).
2. Time Rendered Module - Calculate the time you have rendered.
3. Query Module - Enable you to check/query you logs based on the dates.

Note that this project might only work on a windows machine.

### How it works?

If you have an IDE like DevC++, you can open the main.cpp and compile it. You can also compile and run the program using the code snippet below. Note that you should have g++ library installed on your machine for it to work.

```bash
    g++ -o app app.cpp      // compile
    app.exe                 // run
```
